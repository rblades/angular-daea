Angular daea
====

This is a fork of the [Digital Atlas of Egyptian Archaeology](https://github.com/matrix-msu/daea).

The goal of this fork is to 'wrap' the entire project in [Angular JS](https://github.com/angular) to create a functioning Single Page Application.

### New Project: Where I am at

Attempted to make this project a single page application. I 'wrapped' everything in Angular. But nothing loaded at all. I attempted to create directives from the jquery to no avail. Project always loaded blank running from localhost. Attempted to integrate the Angular Leaflet UI to no avail. 

I wish I had done this on github earlier to track my changes and issues, etc. Unfortunately starting from a half-baked project on my end. You are entering in the middle of a mess I created with no prior knowledge of what worked and what did not work.

Please fork this project, make it your own, collaborate, etc.

###Original information about DAEA:

Collaborative project in the Fall 2014 ANP455: Ancient Egyptian Archaeology class (http://anthropology.msu.edu/anp455-fs14) at Michigan State University. Students all chose a specific site on which to write a site report (details can be found at http://anthropology.msu.edu/anp455-fs14/assignments-grading/).  They created the wb page for the atlas entry (basic HTML, CSS, and some light JS if they felt ambitious), added the pin to the map by adding their site's information (Lat/Lon, time period, brief site description) to a CSV.  Leaflet Omnivore (https://github.com/mapbox/leaflet-omnivore) was used to pull the data out of the CSV and onto a simple Leaflet based map.  In addition to doing focused research and writing on a specific Egyptian archaeological site, students learned basic HTML/CSS and GitHub (forking, pull requests, comitting, etc) during the course of the assignment.  

The project has several goals.  First, it allowed the students to have focused engagement with a specific archaeological site (and write about the site).  Second, students learned some digital skills during the process, such as working with HTML, digital mapping skills, version control, etc (things that are normally not part of a senior level archaeology class...things that they can easily apply in other settings). Finally, students built something public, they contributed to the collective knowledge and resources available on the open web about the archaeology of ancient Egypt
